    <p>Calgary Guide is designed and created by 2nd year students of the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology.
    This project is made solely to help and inform people who are interested on exploring the City of Calgary Alberta. We are the ones who are most 
    aware on how nice this city is, so we want to do our best in giving free information about it in a click. </p>
